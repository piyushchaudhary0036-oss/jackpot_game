The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 10.
It will then ask the player to enter their guess.
It will then check to see if that number is the same as the one the
computer randomly generated; if it is then the player has won.
If the player’s guess is not the same, then it will check to see if the number is higher or lower than the guess and tell the player.
The player will have 4 goes to guess the number correctly; if they don’t guess the number within this number of attempts, then they will be informed that they have lost the game and will be told what the actual number was.
